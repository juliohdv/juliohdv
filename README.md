# Julio Hern√°ndez - @juliohdv

###### Hi there :wink: my name is Julio! A software developer from El Salvador... Computer Systems Engineering student, i have worked on different educational projects to develop my coding skills. I am a self-taught technology addict :eyes:, in love with music and TV shows on the night. 

### Frameworks I've used

* Node.js
* React
* Laravel
* Django

### How do I like to work?

###### I like to understand the problem, that's why I read the instructions as many times as necessary, I discuss ideas with the work team so that we can come up with the perfect solution together. I make lists of tasks in order of importance and execute them by planning them on my calendar.
